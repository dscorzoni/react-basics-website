# My First React Website - Basic Concepts

This website is implemented using React. It uses simple logic breaking each section of the website (header, hero, testimonials, form and footer) into single components. It also uses a sub-component in the testimonials section to render each testimonial separately through props.

CSS is implemented in a separate file (Components.css) that is shared across all components and imported in each one of them.

Another interesting element is implemented in the form section, where I use hooks **useState** and **useRef** to control form elements, handle submission and display a div with a success message conditionally.

In summary, these are React features that you'll find here:

- Basic components structure.
- Calling sub-components with props (Properties).
- Usage of useRef hook to handle form inputs.
- Usage of useState hook to render a div conditionally (success message).
